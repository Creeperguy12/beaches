        <h3> Ka'anapali Beach</h3>

        <p>Ka'anapali Beach is divided into two separate long strands by the forbidding, 300-foot cinder cone of Pu'u Keka'a, known as the Black Rock. The sand shelves away abruptly from both sections, so swimmers soon find themselves in deep water, but bathing is usually safe outside periods of high winter surf. The rugged lava coastline around the Black Rock itself is one of the best snorkelling spots on Maui.

                Non-guests of Ka'anapali's hotels are free to use the main beach, but there are also a couple of public beach parks just around the headland to the south. Both Hanaka'o'o and Wahikuli are right alongside Hwy-30; swimming is generally safer at Wahikuli, but the facilities and general ambience are more appealing at Hanaka'o'o.
